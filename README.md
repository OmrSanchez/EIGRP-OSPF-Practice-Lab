# EIGRP-OSPF-Practice-Lab
This lab was designed to practice and document advanced configurations of EIGRP and OSPF in an enterprise-style environment. The purpose is to reinforce protocol fundamentals, explore advanced features such as summarization and leak-maps, and compare EIGRP’s DUAL algorithm with OSPF’s SPF-based approach.
